It includes utilities for creating, modifying, and chaining prompts together.\\n  \\n2. **Data Augmented Generation**: This component involves integrating the language model with external data sources, such as databases, APIs, and other knowledge bases. The goal is to enhance the capabilities of the language model by providing it with additional context and information.\\n\\nLangChain aims to make it easier for developers to build robust and scalable applications by offering pre-built modules and a flexible architecture that can be customized to fit specific needs.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 216, 'prompt_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 238}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c4e5b6fa31', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-82d57d0e-7004-4258-ad00-7fa58aa63c3e-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 22, 'output_tokens': 216, 'total_tokens': 238}\n"
